; Tests instructions CMP (all addressing modes) & BEQ & BNE.
; Assumes that loads & stores work with all addressing modes.
; Also assumes that AND & ORA & EOR work with all addressing modes.
;
; Expected Results: $15 = 0x7F

; Note that this test does not seem to work in 6502js, but Visual 6502 gives the
; correct result
